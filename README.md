# OODestroyers:tm: Battle Salvo (Server Compatible*)
##### Contributors: [Angelina Dong](https://github.com/angelina-dong), [Pooja Prabu](https://github.com/poojprab)
###### *Compatible with this [BattleShip Server](https://github.com/CS-3500-OOD/BattleshipServer)

Play a classic version of the Battleship game! Players are able to play on the command line for a singleplayer text-based version of the game against an AI, or they can play their AI on the server against other AIs or for a cool visual representation of the game. Ship placements are autogenerated, and users can choose to play on the minimum dimensions of a 6x6 board all the way up to a 15x15 (the board does not have to be a square).

### How To Run OODestroyer's Battle Salvo Server Compatible Game:
- Singleplayer game mode: to play against the AI, make sure the game-mode is SINGLE (default game mode designated in the Driver class) and run the program with zero command line arguments
- Playing on the server (make sure the server is running):
  - To use this AI against another specific AI: change the game-mode to MULTI and run the program with the command line arguments [Host Port] with the other AI computer's host address and port 35001 (or any port that isn't being used)
